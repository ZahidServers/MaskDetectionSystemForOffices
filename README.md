# Face-Mask Detector
Real time face-mask detection using Deep Learning and OpenCV

## About Project
This project uses a Deep Neural Network, more specifically a Convolutional Neural Network, to differentiate between images of people with and without masks. The CNN manages to get an accuracy of **98.2% on the training set** and **97.3% on the test set**. Then the stored weights of this CNN are used to classify as mask or no mask, in real time, using OpenCV. With the webcam capturing the video, the frames are preprocessed and and fed to the model to accomplish this task. The model works efficiently with no apparent lag time between wearing/removing mask and display of prediction. Then if there is no mask it captures the face a store as temporary image then it searches through dictionary for containing images and employee name and looks for the employ that have not wore the maks and prints the employ name.
